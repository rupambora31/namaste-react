## Difference Between Named Export, Default Export, and `*` as Export

- **Named Export:** Exports specific functions, variables, or classes from a module by name. Imported using the same names.
  
- **Default Export:** Exports a single value or function as the default for a module. Imported without curly braces and with any desired name.
  
- **`*` as Export (Wildcard Export):** Exports all values from a module as an object. Imported using the object name with dot notation.

## Importance of `config.js` File

- **Purpose:** Centralizes configuration settings like API keys, environment variables, or constants used throughout an application.
  
- **Advantage:** Simplifies maintenance by storing all configurations in one file, allowing easy adjustments and access across the app.

## React Hooks

- **Definition:** Functions that enable functional components to use state, lifecycle methods, and more without writing a class.
  
## Importance of `useState` Hook

- **Role:** `useState` Hook in React allows functional components to have state variables. It replaces the `this.state` in class components.
  
- **Advantage:** Enables state management in functional components, facilitating simpler and more concise code.

### React Hooks revolutionize functional component development by providing state management and lifecycle features. 

### The `config.js` file centralizes configuration settings.

### While different export methods offer versatility in organizing and importing modules.
